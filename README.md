# quiet-initiative

Simple module to remove the initiative advantage popup for those that like to just click the dice in the combat tracker. Use alt for advantage and ctrl for disadvantage.

Character sheet will still work the correct way.

Use at your own peril!

## Installation

Load the module using the following manifest:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matjam/quiet-initiative/main/module.json
```

I don't intend to put this module on the module catalog because it's my first module and it's kinda doing things in a dirty way.
