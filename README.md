# quiet-initiative

Simple module to remove the initiative advantage popup for those that like to just click the dice in the combat tracker. Use alt for advantage and ctrl for disadvantage.

Character sheet will still work the correct way.

Use at your own peril!

## Why?!

Because in previous releases of dnd5e you could fast forward initiative rolls in midi-qol and since 2.1.x was released, you can't. This module kinda works around that.

## Installation

Load the module using the following manifest:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matjam/quiet-initiative/main/module.json
```

I don't intend to put this module on the module catalog because it's my first module and it's kinda doing things in a dirty way.
